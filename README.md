# pyValkLib
Python library for reading and writing files in the Valkyria Chronicles game series. The goal of this library is to provide interfaces for these files, so that end-user tools can ignore the details of reading and writing them.

pyValkLib is intended as a research tool, with an eventual companion ValkLib library providing a clean C++ implementation of the read-and-write logic.
